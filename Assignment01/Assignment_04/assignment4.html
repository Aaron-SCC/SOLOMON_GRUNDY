Convert number grades to letter grades
This exercise will give you some practice using if statements. 
To start, this application should display a prompt dialog box that 
gets a number grade from 0 through 100. 

Result:
Display an alert dialog box like the one below that displays the 
letter grade for that number, for example:

To derive the letter grade, you should use this table:
A	88-100
B	80-87
C	68-79
D	60-67
F	< 60
If user enters 999 - “Good bye”

*Assume that the user has entered a valid entry.  
*This version of the program does not need to support multiple entries.
